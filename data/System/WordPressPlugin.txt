---++ Usage
This plugin registers a restHandler that allows you to post a Foswiki topic to your wordpress Blog. 

Only one blog can be configured at this stage, and must be set up by the administrator in =configure=, and the user must be an =author=.

If you hit post on a topic more than one time, it will post it multiple times - so be a little careful :).

you may need to enable xmlrpc posting for your wordpress installation.. (http://yourblog.home.org/wp-admin/options-writing.php)

---++ Examples
to post the webstatistics topic to the configured wordpress blog, craft a URL like:

%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/WordPressPlugin/post?topic=Sandbox.WebStatistics
